-------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for checking out my asset!  PSXEffects will help you create that
old, very outdated, yet beautiful look that the first PlayStation console
provides.


This package includes one main script: PSXEffects.cs.  This script handles
setting variables and properties in PSXEffect's shaders and also handles
PSX image effect rendering.  You can set variables in this script during
runtime if needed.

Basic Setup:
To set up PSXEffects quickly, drag the PSXEffects prefab from the Prefabs
folder into the scene.  You can also place the PSXEffects.cs script on any
camera.  If you place it on a GameObject without a Camera component, one
will be created for you.

PSXEffects.cs properties:
- Custom Resolution: Allows you to apply a fixed resolution. (default: false)
- Resolution: The fixed downscale resolution. (default: 620, 480)
- Resolution Factor: Determines how pixelated the main display is rendered. (you can find a pre-made canvas in the included Prefabs folder) (default: 2)
- Target Framerate: Sets the project's max framerate to this number. (the same as setting Application.targetFrameRate) (default: -1)
- Frame Skip: Determines the frame gap between PSXEffects render calls to the camera. (default: 0)
- Enable Camera Position Inaccuracy: Toggles camera position snapping. (default: false)
- Camera Inaccuracy: How many units the camera should snap. (default: 0.05)
- Affine Texture Mapping: Simulates the PSX's distorted texture look. (default: true)
- Polygonal Draw Distance: Simulates culling of entire polygons in many PSX games relative to the distance from the camera. (default: 0)
- Polygon Inaccuracy: Simulates the look of the PSX's lack of a Z-buffer. (default: 2)
- Vertex Inaccuracy: Simulates vertex snapping. (default: 30)
- Use World Space Snapping: Determines whether to snap vertices in world space instead of screen space. (default: false)
- Camera-Based Snapping: Takes camera's transform into account when snapping vertices. (default: false)
- Saturated Diffuse: Adds a little more darkness to the dark side of meshes. (default: 20)
- Shadow Type: Defines which style of realtime shadows to use. "Default" equates to normal shadows while "PSX" means shadows use subtractive alpha blending. (default: Default)
- Use Skybox Lighting: Toggles whether to gather color from the skybox. (default: false)
- Enable Post Processing: Toggles post processing on or off. (default: true)
- Color Depth: Simulates how many bits are used for color per pixel. (default: 5)
- Subtraction Fade: Fades the screen just like original PSX games. (default: 0)
- Darken Darks/Favor Red: Darkens dark colors and subtly tints them red like PSX lighting. (default: 1)
- Scanlines: Draws scanlines on the screen. (default: false)
- Vertical: Toggles vertical/horizontal scanlines. (default: true)
- Scanline Intensity: Changes how intense the scanline effect is. (default: 5)
- Enable Dithering: Simulates PSX dithering effects. (default: true)
- Dithering Method: Determines which dithering algorithm to use. (default: Basic)
- Dither Texture: Determines what texture to use to dither.
- Dither Intensity: Changes how intense the dithering effect is. (default: 12)
- Dither Skybox: Determines whether to remove the skybox/non-opaque PS1Shader materials from the dithering effect. (default: true)


PSXEffects comes with a very important shader: PS1Shader.shader.
Creative name huh?  This shader handles the look of all models.

PS1Shader.shader properties:
- Render Mode: Determines which method is used to render the material.
- Blend Operation: Sets the alpha blending operation for this material. Great for simulating PSX-styled shadows.
- Ignore Depth Buffer: Prevents writing this material to the depth buffer. Used mostly for the "Dither Skybox" property.
- Backface Culling: Toggles rendering the back side of faces.
- Unlit: Toggles scene lighting on the object.
- Draw Distance Influence: Determines whether the material should cull polygons based off of the polygonal draw distance. (default: true)
- Vertex Inaccuracy Override: Overrides the global vertex inaccuracy setting for the specific material. Values over 0 will override the global value while values under 0 will use the global value. (default: -1.0)
- Color: Tinting of the object. (default: white)
- Main Texture: The main texture. (default: white)
- Diffuse Mode: Determines whether to calculate diffuse lighting in the vertex or fragment shader. (default: Vertex)
- Normal Map: The normal map. (default: bump)
- Specular Mode: Determines whether to use Phong or Gouraud specular shading. (default: Gouraud)
- Specular Map: A black and white texture that determines which parts are glossy. (default: white)
- Specular Amount: Level of glossiness. (default: 0.0)
- Metal Map: A texture that uses the red channel to determine metalness and the alpha channel for smoothness. (default: white)
- Metallic Amount: The metalness of the material. (default: 0.0)
- Smoothness: The smoothness of the material. (default: 0.5)
- Emission Map: A texture that determines which parts emit more color. (default: white)
- Emission Amount: A value that determines how much the material emits color. (default: 0)
- Cubemap: Cubemap reflection. (default: rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
- LOD Texture: A texture that will show up similar to draw distance, but intended for lower-res textures. (default: white)
- LOD Amount: The distance from the camera that the LOD texture will show up. (default: 0)


Tips:
--Stretching with affine mapping--
When affine mapping is turned on, textures will stretch like crazy when the
camera gets close.  This effect is more noticable if the model's polygons
are bigger in size.  To tone down the stretching, subdivide your polygons
that are affected by extreme affine mapping stretching.

--ProBuilder black objects--
If using ProBuilder and the object turns black when applying a PSXEffects
material, uncheck "Lightmap Static" under the object's Mesh Renderer.

--Consistent frame skip--
By default, PSXEffects' Frame Skip option skips x amount of frames between
RenderTexture renders.  If your screen's refresh rate is different from
someone else's, the FPS they'll be seeing is also different.  To combat this,
set the Target Framerate option to a normal refresh rate (like 60 or so).

--Getting your scene to look as PSX-accurate as possible--
To accurately simulate the look of a PSX game, there are a few things to consider:

- Most PSX games (like 99% of them) will not have any realtime lighting at all.
This includes directional lights, point lights, spot lights, etc. What developers did instead
was use vertex coloring to make objects look shaded. This is possible with PSXEffects
thanks to its support for vertex colors. Enabling "Unlit" on your materials will
automatically prevent lighting influence on it as well as greatly improve performance.
- To go along with the above point, don't use realtime shadows. PSX games usually have
no shadows and some instead use mesh-based blob shadows.
- Change your resolution to something low like 320x240. The resolution settings on the
PSXEffects component will help you achieve this.
- Make use of linear fog when making a horror-type game as fog can really help set the
entire mood for your game.
- For non-opaque materials, try messing with the "Ignore Depth Buffer" property. The
PSX lacked a Z-buffer, so developers had to write their own implementations to simulate one.
This property allows materials to not be written to the depth buffer and can create
some familiar looking results if checked.

--Updating values--
If you want to ever update any values of the PSXEffects script, the function
PSXEffects.UpdateProperties() must be called in order for those values to update and
be sent to the shaders.
